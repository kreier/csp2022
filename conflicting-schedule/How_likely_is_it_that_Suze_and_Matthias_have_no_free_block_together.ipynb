        "A mayor problem for the whole CSE department in 2022-2023 is that there is not a single block where not at least one member is teaching. This makes collaborative planning difficult. That bages the question: How likely is that?\n",
        "\n",
        "Since we have 8 blocks, where we either teach or not, this schedule can be represented by 8 symbols. For the collaborative planning it is only relevant if we teach or not, so a binary representation is possible. Therefore the teaching schedule for this purpuse can be represented by 8 bits or 1 Byte for each teacher.\n",

        "Having 8 bits can store 256 different values. But obviously not all represent a valid teaching schedule. 00 is for vacation and FF would be nonstop teaching. If teaching is 1 and not teaching is zero, we need to find the bytes with only 5 ones and 3 zeros. Since the data set is so small, we can use brute force:"
